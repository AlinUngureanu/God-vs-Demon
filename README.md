# God-vs-Demon

This program is a simple game that simulates a battle between a god and a demon. Two players log into the platform using a username and password to enter the game. One of them will play the role of the god and the other the role of the demon. Each player chooses the character they think is stronger, entering details such as name, damage, health, special ability, etc. from the keyboard.

The fight starts by generating a random number between 1 and 100. If the number is even, the god attacks first, and if it is odd, the demon starts. Each player chooses an attack type, and if they miss the command, they lose their turn. The battle continues until one of the players reaches 0 or below 0 health. The winner is the one left with positive health points.

The game can be resumed for a new battle if the players wish, and so on until they decide to stop playing.

The application uses Object-Oriented Programming principles, as can be seen in the picture below.
